## Alzheimer's Detection from ADNI data
###### This project was submitted to fulfill requirements for the Intro to Data Science (CS109A) course at the Harvard Graduate School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

#### Data set
For this analysis, two data sets were merged:
  1. ADNIMERGE - Contains data about various clinical, genetic, and imaging biomarkers from participants a longitudinal multi-center study.

  2. UPENN-CSF - Contains information about concentration of Amyloid beta compounds in cerebro-spinal fluid, which has been known to be strongly correlated to risk of Alzheimer's disease.

  Both data sets are freely available (with controlled access) at adni.loni.usc.edu

  *Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease
  Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators
  within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data
  but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report. A complete listing of ADNI
  investigators can be found at:

#### Objective
 The question being answered can be stated as follows:

- What is the minimal set of diagnostic predictors (i.e biomarkers) that can lower the overall cost of clinical testing without sacrificing a substantial degree of diagnostic accuracy?

Thus, goal of the analysis is not to predict incidence of Alzheimer's disease, but to analyze which clinical diagnostic tests have the most influence on final positive diagnosis.
